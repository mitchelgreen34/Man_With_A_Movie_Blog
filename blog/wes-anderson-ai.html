        Anyone who has spent any time in film circles of the internet over the last few months has no doubt seen a plethora of AI renderings of different properties done by filmmakers with distinct styles. Questions that nobody ever asked can now be answered.

        The people making these unimaginative knock-offs are trying to show how well AI can recreate the work of human artists, and according to them, if the technology is good enough, it opens up a whole new world of possibilities for wannabe independent filmmakers, writers, etc. That’s certainly what the incompetent executives who run the biggest studios in Hollywood want people to believe, as it will give them a near-endless stream of content without paying real artists and craftspeople a

        The most prevalent filmmaker aped for their aesthetic appears to be Wes Anderson, likely the only director with any overly noticeable style that any of these artistically incurious tech bros have ever heard of. Anderson has a unique and inspiring style, and parodies and rip-offs of it have been ubiquitous for decades — and have seen an even larger resurgence with a recent TikTok trend. But the problems with these AI recreations — and to a far lesser extent those that are human made — are that they don’t actually capture Wes Anderson’s style, formally and especially not in content.

      <h13>
        These AI Wes Anderson recreations seem to be formed from an amalgamation of tropes propagated more by the Saturday Night Live 
        "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfDIAZCwHQE"style="color: #182436;"><u>Wes Anderson Horror Trailer</u></a>" 
        sketch than anything in his movies. These recreations have quirky, overly-pretentious titles like 
        "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-8DT5Q8kzI"style="color: #182436;"><u>The Galactic Menagerie</u></a>" and 
        "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGi2cVrROWQ"style="color: #182436;"><u>The Delightful Dinosaur Diaries</u></a>" 
        instead of the relatively mundane “The French Dispatch” or “Isle of Dogs,” titles usually pulled from objects or settings in the movies as opposed to a random collection of adjectives and nouns pulled out of a thesaurus.

      <h13>
        They are given vibrant, pastel color palettes like Anderson’s films often have, but unlike in those, where this artifice both creates a sense of time and place and acts as a mask for the characters to hide their deep-rooted sadness, the color palettes in the recreations don’t have any meaning. Every image looks the same and doesn’t say anything about character, story, or mood.

        The most maddening example of how badly the AI misunderstands Anderson’s work is how it appears to be trained to know Wes Anderson likes to use symmetry in his shot composition but nothing else. It doesn’t understand the precision with which Anderson moves the camera for dramatic and comedic purposes. It doesn’t understand how Anderson uses extra space on the edge of the frame to add details to create a more lived-in world. It doesn’t understand how Anderson blocks his actors to help you understand character dynamics and personalities. Look at the following two images, one a shot of most of the ensemble from “The Royal Tenenbaums” and the other a group shot from an AI’s interpretation of “Jurassic Park” by Wes Anderson.

        Apart from generally looking terrible — with people who look like their faces are melting and a non-descript background — the AI image has its characters standing symmetrically in a vast room without any thought given to their relative positioning or poses. There is no information about the world or these characters.

        Contrast that with the frame from “The Royal Tenenbaums.” Here, the family is split in the image by the fake doctor Royal has hired to give him a false diagnosis. Those on the left, more distant from Royal, are the least trusting of him in that given moment. This is particularly true of Chas and Henry, who stand defensively in the back of the frame. Richie sits close to him, trying more than the other two to reconnect with Royal, but they still don’t understand each other yet. On the right of the doctor are Ari and Uzi, Chas’s two children who have no reason not to trust their grandfather at this point and who will become close with him by the end of the film. Etheline is also there, giving Royal the benefit of the doubt because she thinks he’s dying but keeping her distance by standing in the back. Margot has no relationship with her father but stands behind her mother as a protector. And Pagoda, Royal’s loyal right-hand man stands behind him, always having his back. This single shot conveys information about nine different characters and their relationship to the man in the center, and all AI can do is position the characters to make the image look symmetrical.

        And then there is the substance of Anderson’s work that AI could never replicate. His films’ witty humor — in particular Anderson’s sense of visual comedy, using perfectly timed pans, tilts, and cuts to tell a joke — is absent from any of these dry AI recreations. The depth of character in Anderson’s films is something AI can’t recreate. If there is any character in these videos it is painfully surface-level. Most importantly, AI can never replicate the melancholy that is the backbone of Anderson’s films. This sadness makes his unique style meaningful. It allows simple, deadpan lines like 
        "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtiowtWMHxI"style="color: #182436;"><u>I’ve had a rough year, Dad.</u></a>" and 
        "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CeP-K7Tq2Q"style="color: #182436;"><u>I wonder if it remembers me.</u></a>" 
        to have a devastating power because it finally allows the audience to breach the shield created by the artifice and connect to the characters. AI, because of its inhumanity, keeps an audience at a distance at all times. It could never allow audiences to connect to it because there is nothing to connect to.

      <h13>
        Wes Anderson films without Wes Anderson are just shallow, lifeless husks of better films — ones that say something, ask questions, and push boundaries. Art can be aided by technology, but human touch makes it special because it is an expression of who we are. AI “art” isn’t expression, it’s copying. Not in a plagiaristic sense, but in the sense that it can never create anything new. The nature of the technology means everything it spits out will have come from something before and algorithmically determined to be the most appealing. There’s no risk in that, no excitement. It’s what Wes Anderson's films have never been: boring.
